# Bracket Challenge

A Portfolio Project by Jeremy Moseley

React web app using Material-UI and Redux. Written in TypeScript.

Redux is complete overkill, but allows for more modular code.

Game organization is displayed with flexbox containers.

The lowest seed always faces the highest advancing seed making for some interesting game logic.
